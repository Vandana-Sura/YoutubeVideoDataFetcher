Before the year 2000, if you wanted to make a lot of money in a predictable career you needed a nice suit and an important looking business card. Your options where finance, medicine, law or senior company management if you were lucky. 


But then‚Ä¶ just a few years later at around about the same time as those people in their fancy suits were blowing up the global economy a new breed of millionaire was entering the mainstream. 

They replaced the puffer vests and Bloomberg terminals with flip flops and vim terminals‚Ä¶ 

Tech bro‚Äôs worked fewer hours, had better perks and in many cases made better money than their peers in more traditional high-income roles‚Ä¶

What‚Äôs more is that people didn‚Äôt hate them‚Ä¶ 

Executives, bankers and their fancy lawyers were rightfully blamed for enriching themselves by leeching off a broken system that cost people their homes, their jobs, and their futures‚Ä¶ 

Meanwhile people loved the idea of hacky sack playing nerds making millions by actually making stuff that improved our lives‚Ä¶ 

But now‚Ä¶ 15 years later the tech bros became everything they promised to destroy‚Ä¶ and they kind of destroyed themselves in the process‚Ä¶

For a while you could have a great degree of confidence in becoming filthy rich by putting in a few years at a major Silicon Valley tech company‚Ä¶ but this all relied on a stream of money that wasn‚Äôt coming from nowhere‚Ä¶ 

Venture capital, the firms that ACTUALLY invest in early-stage start-ups to develop their new technology NEVER again actually reached the level of financing it did during the dot com bubble. 

That was‚Ä¶ until something changed in 2021‚Ä¶ 

So it‚Äôs time to learn How Money Works to find out how Tech Bro‚Äôs ruined tech for themselves‚Ä¶",How Money Works,"tech industry, tech investing, biggest tech companies, tech layoffs, best companies to work for, coding career, tech industry career, how much do coders make, how much do google coders make, venture capital, technology venture capital, rise and fall of tech bros, how money works, how history works, tech career, is coding a good career, computer science career, highest paying companies",27,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society,2024-09-12T14:36:48Z,PT11M36S,1334783,3177,false,Not Available,Not Provided

Then we can have it for free so we can donate it to someone in need. But first we need to clean it. The most common reason technology fails, from gaming computers, to workstation laptops, is due to lack of maintenance. If your tech gets slow after being on for a few minutes, it's worth checking the CPU heatsink first to see if it's overheating. Keeping your computer clean is key to having a fast machine.

Lyrics
[Intro: 50 Cent]
Somethin' special
Unforgettable
50 Cent (Cent)
Justin ('tin)
Timbaland ('land)
Godd***, d***

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
She, she, she want it, I wanna give it to her
She know that it's right here for her
I wanna see her break it down (Yeah)
I'm ballin', throwing money 'round

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
She a working girl, she work the pole
She break it down, she take it low
She fine as h***, she 'bout the dough
She doing her thing out on the floor
Her money-money, she make it, make it
Look at the way she shake it, shake it
Make you wanna touch it, make you wanna taste it
Have you lusting for it, going crazy, face it
Now don't stop, get it, get it
The way she shake it make you wanna hit it
Think she double-jointed from the way she split it
Got your head f***ed up from the way she did it
She so much more than you used to
She know just how to move to seduce you
She gon' do the right thing and touch the right spots
And dance in your lap 'til you ready to pop

[Bridge: 50 Cent & Justin Timberlake; Justin Timberlake]
She always ready, when you want it, she want it
Like a nympho, the info, I'll show you where to meet her
On the late night, 'til daylight, the club jumping
If you want a good time, she gon' give you what you want
Let me talk to you

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, you're so new-age, you're like my new craze
Let's get together, maybe we can start a new phase
This smoke's got the club all hazy
Spotlights don't do you justice, baby
Why don't you come over here?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You got me saying, ""Ayo!"" I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me?
Ayo! I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her

[Post-Chorus: Timbaland]
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you, girl

[Verse 2: 50 Cent; 50 Cent w/ Justin Timberlake; Justin Timberlake]
Got a thing for that thing she got
The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
I make it rain for her so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In the fantasy, it's plain to see
Just how it be, her and me
Backstroking, sweat soaking all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this b**** 'til the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that‚Äîthat there should be 'gainst the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down
Know I like when you're hype and you throw it all around
Different style, different mood, d***, I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I'll do to you
Let's get it poppin', shawty, we could switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen
Let me talk to you

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, you're so new-age, you're like my new craze
Let's get together, maybe we can start a new phase
This smoke's got the club all hazy
Spotlights don't do you justice, baby
Why don't you come over here?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You got me saying, ""Ayo!"" I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me?
Ayo! I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her

[Post-Chorus: Timbaland]
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3uiMsqptOs,Pre-Egyptian Technology Left By an Advanced Civilization That Disappeared,"The concept of an advanced pre-Egyptian civilization, existing before the well-documented dynastic periods of ancient Egypt, is supported by the advanced technological features of sites like the Osireion, Zawyet el Aryan, the Serapeum of Saqqara, and many others. this lost civilization might have had a profound understanding of astronomy, engineering, and mathematics, far beyond what was typical for the time. Evidence suggested includes the alignment of the Giza pyramids with the stars of Orion's Belt, hinting at sophisticated astronomical knowledge, and the remarkable precision in the construction of these pyramids, suggesting advanced architectural and engineering techniques. Additionally, there are discussions about the potential use of advanced tools and methods for cutting and transporting massive stone blocks, which would require a level of technology not conventionally attributed to the ancient Egyptians of the well-known dynastic periods.

Before the year 2000, if you wanted to make a lot of money in a predictable career you needed a nice suit and an important looking business card. Your options where finance, medicine, law or senior company management if you were lucky. 


But then‚Ä¶ just a few years later at around about the same time as those people in their fancy suits were blowing up the global economy a new breed of millionaire was entering the mainstream. 

They replaced the puffer vests and Bloomberg terminals with flip flops and vim terminals‚Ä¶ 

Tech bro‚Äôs worked fewer hours, had better perks and in many cases made better money than their peers in more traditional high-income roles‚Ä¶

What‚Äôs more is that people didn‚Äôt hate them‚Ä¶ 

Executives, bankers and their fancy lawyers were rightfully blamed for enriching themselves by leeching off a broken system that cost people their homes, their jobs, and their futures‚Ä¶ 

Meanwhile people loved the idea of hacky sack playing nerds making millions by actually making stuff that improved our lives‚Ä¶ 

But now‚Ä¶ 15 years later the tech bros became everything they promised to destroy‚Ä¶ and they kind of destroyed themselves in the process‚Ä¶

For a while you could have a great degree of confidence in becoming filthy rich by putting in a few years at a major Silicon Valley tech company‚Ä¶ but this all relied on a stream of money that wasn‚Äôt coming from nowhere‚Ä¶ 

Venture capital, the firms that ACTUALLY invest in early-stage start-ups to develop their new technology NEVER again actually reached the level of financing it did during the dot com bubble. 

That was‚Ä¶ until something changed in 2021‚Ä¶ 

So it‚Äôs time to learn How Money Works to find out how Tech Bro‚Äôs ruined tech for themselves‚Ä¶",How Money Works,"tech industry, tech investing, biggest tech companies, tech layoffs, best companies to work for, coding career, tech industry career, how much do coders make, how much do google coders make, venture capital, technology venture capital, rise and fall of tech bros, how money works, how history works, tech career, is coding a good career, computer science career, highest paying companies",27,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society,2024-09-12T14:36:48Z,PT11M36S,1334783,3177,false,Not Available,Not Provided

LYRICS:
2.5 million years ago, a friend of mine 
Made a tool from a stone and defended his tribe
It‚Äôs technology, sorry for the technical term
It‚Äôs a wheel, then a fire and the rest is a blur 
Throw a theorized plot in the pot with applied science 
Let it sit, I bet it streamlines your environs
What‚Äôs a resource local to the grotto
The method isn‚Äôt free until the mechanism follow 
That‚Äôs technology, innovate a difference
A feat of engineering, a system made efficient 
There isn‚Äôt a condition, complication, or revision 
Where the answer ain‚Äôt to build a more sophisticated widget 
Idget, tired of games, Bronze Age, Iron Age
Weaponry in stellar form, shelter finer by the day
Live stock and vegetables in rows behind the hideaway
Mesopotamia out the muhfuckin' lion cage

If it's out of the bag, then it's out of bag
If it's out of the bag, then it's out of bag
If it's out of the bag, then it's out of bag
Now that is a powerful cat
 
Now that is a powerful cat

Now that is a powerful cat

You take a lever and a pulley and a winch and a wedge 
You get a labyrinth of aqueducts and pyramid steps
Before the Jesus, Archimedes on that miracle tech 
Year zero, you could feel the future rearing its head
Put a shoe on a horse, shoot a man with a gun 
Steampower, bifocals, and mechanical funk
Manipulate electricity, no it can not be done
Yes it can, ain‚Äôt a dam that could cancel the flood
True to human curiosity, at the tree of knowledge 
Pulling genies out of bottles, stealing from Leonardos
Plane train auto, hauling space age cargo
Bizarro technology, everyday is tomorrow 
Telegraph, telephone, you could flirt with Doris 
In Poughkeepsie from a cozy geodesic dome in Sydney 
You can write a letter with no paper
You could fix anything with a laser

If it's out of the bag, then it's out of bag
If it's out of the bag, then it's out of bag
If it's out of the bag, then it's out of bag
Now that is a powerful cat
 
Now that is a powerful cat

Now that is a powerful cat

You could get a robot limb for your blown off limb, 
Later on the same technology could automate your gig
As awesome as it is
Wait It gets awful, you could split a atom willy-nilly 
If it‚Äôs energy that can be used for killing then it will be 
It‚Äôs not about a better knife, It‚Äôs chemistry and genocide 
And medicine for tempering the heck in the projector light 
Landmines, agent orange, leaded gas, cigarettes
Cameras in your favorite corners, plastic in the wilderness
We can not be trusted with the stuff that we come up with 
The machinery could eat us, we just really just love our buttons
Ummm... technology, focus on the other shit 
3D-printed body parts, dehydrated onion dip
You could buy a jet-ski from a cell phone on a jumbo jet  
T-E-C-H-N-O-L-O-G-Y, it‚Äôs the ultimate


If it's out of the bag, then it's out of bag
If it's out of the bag, then it's out of bag
If it's out of the bag, then it's out of bag
Now that is a powerful cat
 
Now that is a powerful cat

Now that is a powerful cat

Williams X Jet

The Williams X-Jet, developed by Williams International, was a small, single-person, lightweight vertical take-off and landing aircraft powered by a modified Williams F107 turbofan engine ‚Äî designated WR-19-7 ‚Äî with some minor modifications. Because of its design, the craft was dubbed ""The Flying Pulpit"". It was designed to transport one operator and be controlled by leaning in the desired direction while regulating engine output power. It could move in any direction, accelerate quickly, hover and rotate on its axis, as well as remain aloft for up to 45 minutes, and travel at speeds of up to 60 mph. The United States Army evaluated it in the 1980s, but it was deemed inferior to the capabilities of helicopters and small, uncrewed aircraft, so the X-Jet program was halted.

The Radiant Energy Device

Dr. T. Henry Moray of Salt Lake City invented the first gadget to extract energy from the meta frequency oscillations of empty space in the early 1900s. Moray was eventually able to create a free energy gadget that weighed sixty pounds and generated 50,000 watts of electricity for several hours. Ironically, despite frequently demonstrating his gadget to scientists and engineers, Moray was unable to secure money to further develop the device into a usable power station capable of supplying electrical power on a large scale. Before World War II, Moray worked briefly with the Rural Electrification Agency on the machine's development. At the time, the R.E.A. was reportedly penetrated by Communist supporters and high-ranking officers with a distinctly pinkish tint. These officials repeatedly pressed Moray to pass over all details of his gadget to the Soviet Union, including arranging for high-level Soviet scientists to visit the Moray laboratory to view the device in action. On the initiative of the Communist-infiltrated R.E.A., one person‚Äîlet us call him ""Z""‚Äîspent about two months in Moray's laboratory and managed to gain Moray's full confidence. Moray eventually revealed most of the secrets of the manufacture of his special valve to ""Z""‚Äîthe only person in whom Moray had ever entirely confided. There is considerable evidence that ""Z"" was a Soviet operative, and that this was where the Soviets originally got the idea to construct the hyperspace amplifiers that would later be utilized in their psychotronic weapons.",The Brilliant,"Forbidden Technologies and The Silencing of Their Inventors, discovery, inventions, unexplained, mysterious, universe, techology, facts, interesting, scientists discovery, inventors, silenced, innovations, myterious, creators, inventors and inventions, inventions guy, imgur inventions, simple inventions, mystery, science, terrifying discovery, inventions and inventors, history, historical, historical facts, weird history, secrets, tesla, energy, dark energy, gadgets, tools, Forbidden, Forbidden inventions",27,,2024-05-02T13:10:13Z,PT22M16S,1410230,1066,false,Not Available,Not Provided

The Dark Side of DARPA | The Human Cost of Technological Supremacy

DARPA is the secretive U.S. defense agency behind groundbreaking technologies like the internet and GPS. It uncovers DARPA's lesser-known projects and controversial experiments that push ethical boundaries.

The episode weighs DARPA's positive innovations against its more questionable endeavors. Does the agency's pursuit of cutting-edge tech justify some of its shadier activities?

You'll discover surprising facts about DARPA's influence on daily life and national security. This enigmatic organization shapes our world in ways most people never realize.

Ultimately, you'll be left pondering whether DARPA is a force for good -- or cause for concern.

Williams X Jet

The Williams X-Jet, developed by Williams International, was a small, single-person, lightweight vertical take-off and landing aircraft powered by a modified Williams F107 turbofan engine ‚Äî designated WR-19-7 ‚Äî with some minor modifications. Because of its design, the craft was dubbed ""The Flying Pulpit"". It was designed to transport one operator and be controlled by leaning in the desired direction while regulating engine output power. It could move in any direction, accelerate quickly, hover and rotate on its axis, as well as remain aloft for up to 45 minutes, and travel at speeds of up to 60 mph. The United States Army evaluated it in the 1980s, but it was deemed inferior to the capabilities of helicopters and small, uncrewed aircraft, so the X-Jet program was halted.

The Radiant Energy Device

Dr. T. Henry Moray of Salt Lake City invented the first gadget to extract energy from the meta frequency oscillations of empty space in the early 1900s. Moray was eventually able to create a free energy gadget that weighed sixty pounds and generated 50,000 watts of electricity for several hours. Ironically, despite frequently demonstrating his gadget to scientists and engineers, Moray was unable to secure money to further develop the device into a usable power station capable of supplying electrical power on a large scale. Before World War II, Moray worked briefly with the Rural Electrification Agency on the machine's development. At the time, the R.E.A. was reportedly penetrated by Communist supporters and high-ranking officers with a distinctly pinkish tint. These officials repeatedly pressed Moray to pass over all details of his gadget to the Soviet Union, including arranging for high-level Soviet scientists to visit the Moray laboratory to view the device in action.

By contextualizing technological advancements within both societal and business landscapes, she unveils the current state of affairs and sheds light on what the future holds. Haar grote nieuwsgierigheid naar het menselijk gedrag en nieuwe technologische mogelijkheden leidde tot een glansrijke carri√®re in innovatie. Na vele innovatieprojecten bij grote bedrijven en startups raakte Deborah steeds meer ge√Ønteresseerd in de psychologische kant van innovatie: waarom omarmen sommige mensen technologische innovaties direct, terwijl anderen weerstand ervaren? Dit bracht haar op het snijvlak van psychologie, technologie en business. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

This week David, Dana and Max are joined by Bloomberg Technology co-host Ed Ludlow to take a deep dive into all things Tesla, in advance of today‚Äôs fateful earnings report. Things are looking increasingly bleak for the company and we'll soon know if the numbers match the mood set by last week's layoffs. Also discussed: BINGO! And then, is Elon Musk feuding with Tucker Carlson? Max seems to think so, Dana is not so sure.

Tesla Bots will be sent to work on the Moon, and A.I. chat bots will guide people into dreams that they can control (lucid dreams). And what happens when humanity forms a deeper understanding of dark energy, worm holes, and black holes. What type of new technologies could this advanced knowledge develop? Could SpaceX launch 100 Artificial Intelligence Starships, spread across our Solar System and beyond into Interstellar space, working together to form a cosmic internet, creating the Encyclopedia of the Galaxy. Could Einstein‚Äôs equations lead to technologies in teleportation, and laboratory grown black holes. 

Other topics covered in this sci-fi documentary video include: the building of super projects made possible by advancing fusion energy, the possibilities of brain chips, new age space technology and spacecraft such as a hover bike developed for the Moon in 2050, Mars colonization, and technology predictions based on black holes, biotechnology, and when will humanity become a Kardashev Type 1, and then Type 2 Civilization.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOIPmQrrgnQ,Where Are Laid Off Tech Employees Going? | CNBC Marathon,"CNBC explores challenges currently facing U.S. tech workers, including mass layoffs, widespread cuts in company budgets, and threats of deportation for H-1B visa holders.

""The layoffs to the start of 2024 signal a dramatic shift in the tech industry,"" said Jeff Shulman, professor at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business. The number of tech sector layoffs in 2024 has been outpacing the number of terminations in 2023. So far, about 42,324 tech employees were let go in 2024, according to

Layoffs.fyi, which tracks layoffs in the tech industry.

While layoffs have put stress on the workforce, a booming artificial intelligence market is giving the industry a renewed sense of optimism. Generative AI startup deals announced or finalized in the first quarter of this year totaled more than $12 billion compared to about $4.5 billion invested in the space last year, according to PitchBook.

On July 16, 2023, Canada opened visa applications for a pilot program that would allow up to 10,000 H-1B visa holders in the United States to apply for a three-year open-work permit in Canada. H-1B holders are highly educated and specialized foreign workers that work in fields such as tech. After massive layoffs in the tech industry, this was a lifeline for H-1B holders who needed to find a new job or face deportation.

About This Video:
I built Mud walls and capped them with roof tiles to protect them from rain. Mud walls if left uncovered in wet weather will dissolve in the rain and collapse. I wanted to test a solution to this problem by covering the walls with roof tiles. I start the video firring the roof tiles made in the previous video before making another batch to dry out ready for firing. Then I started building the mud walls by digging a foundation trench and filling it with rubble. The rubble was then capped with large stones completing the foundation. This was done so that water at ground level wouldn't wick up the mud wall and weaken it. The mud was then made from water and soil around the build site. The mud was then piled in layers about 5 cm thick and 25 cm wide to form 2 opposing walls 2.25 m long. When the wall was 75 cm high, the bricks were laid on one side of the tops of the walls and the tiles put on these in such a way as to give them a 30 degree slope. It then rained on the walls without ill effect. The tiles can be taken off and new layers added periodically. The mud wall capped with roof tiles seems to be a good process for building mud walls in a wet climate. Hopefully, it will work before a roof can be built over the walls. 

About Primitive Technology:
Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.

Tesla Bots will be sent to work on the Moon, and A.I. chat bots will guide people into dreams that they can control (lucid dreams). And what happens when humanity forms a deeper understanding of dark energy, worm holes, and black holes. What type of new technologies could this advanced knowledge develop? Could SpaceX launch 100 Artificial Intelligence Starships, spread across our Solar System and beyond into Interstellar space, working together to form a cosmic internet, creating the Encyclopedia of the Galaxy. Could Einstein‚Äôs equations lead to technologies in teleportation, and laboratory grown black holes. 

Other topics covered in this sci-fi documentary video include: the building of super projects made possible by advancing fusion energy, the possibilities of brain chips, new age space technology and spacecraft such as a hover bike developed for the Moon in 2050, Mars colonization, and technology predictions based on black holes, biotechnology, and when will humanity become a Kardashev Type 1, and then Type 2 Civilization.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3uiMsqptOs,Pre-Egyptian Technology Left By an Advanced Civilization That Disappeared,"The concept of an advanced pre-Egyptian civilization, existing before the well-documented dynastic periods of ancient Egypt, is supported by the advanced technological features of sites like the Osireion, Zawyet el Aryan, the Serapeum of Saqqara, and many others. this lost civilization might have had a profound understanding of astronomy, engineering, and mathematics, far beyond what was typical for the time. Evidence suggested includes the alignment of the Giza pyramids with the stars of Orion's Belt, hinting at sophisticated astronomical knowledge, and the remarkable precision in the construction of these pyramids, suggesting advanced architectural and engineering techniques. Additionally, there are discussions about the potential use of advanced tools and methods for cutting and transporting massive stone blocks, which would require a level of technology not conventionally attributed to the ancient Egyptians of the well-known dynastic periods.

Order yourself a LARQ Bottle PureVis 2 to go plastic free and enjoy ice cold water throughout the entire day. https://bylarq.com/undecidedpv2 Solar panels are typically made with silicon as their semiconducting material. Cadmium telluride based photovoltaics (or CdTe for short) are the second-most common kind of panels after silicon PV, but when silicon still makes up the vast majority of the market, that doesn‚Äôt mean as much. So what on earth are cadmium telluride solar panels? And if they‚Äôre already in use today, why are they the solar panel industry‚Äôs best-kept secret?

In the last 10 years, according to official scientific records, Arctic sea ice has been melting at a rate of approximately 12.2% per year. Now, to prevent this Arctic sea ice from melting, a Dutch start up named 'Arctic Reflections' is launching a mega-project that is as ambitious as Mars colonization! They are aiming to refreeze an area of 15.5 million square kilometers, which is equivalent to five times the size of India, within a deadline of just 6 YEARS! For this purpose, quite paradoxically, they are planning to spray salty water, known as brine, over the entire snow-covered North Pole.
For those who don't know, brine‚Äîtraditionally called salty water‚Äîis typically used by all snow-covered countries to prevent snow from freezing on their roads . Because when snow falls, it melts as soon as it comes into contact with this brine. So, how are these scientists going to refreeze snow, which melts the ice? Let's find out!

The fear is that this will lead US & EU companies to go bust. China has hit back, saying that there is no overcapacity in its 3 clean tech industries, and accusing some of these countries of being protectionist.

Who is right? Are we about to see a trade war erupt between EU and China, similar to what we had seen between the US and China?

Heat transfer occurs at a lower rate in materials of low thermal conductivity than in materials of high thermal conductivity. For instance, metals typically have high thermal conductivity and are very efficient at conducting heat, while the opposite is true for insulating materials like Rockwool or Styrofoam. Correspondingly, materials of high thermal conductivity are widely used in heat sink applications, and materials of low thermal conductivity are used as thermal insulation. The reciprocal of thermal conductivity is called thermal resistivity.",aryanlovescode,,28,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology",2022-10-12T14:30:05Z,PT24S,27957711,897,false,Not Available,Not Provided

The fear is that this will lead US & EU companies to go bust. China has hit back, saying that there is no overcapacity in its 3 clean tech industries, and accusing some of these countries of being protectionist.

Who is right? Are we about to see a trade war erupt between EU and China, similar to what we had seen between the US and China?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEl-Y1NvBVI,Primitive Technology: Cord drill and Pump drill,"I made a cord drill and then upgraded it to a pump drill. A cord drill is basically a spindle with a fly wheel attached so it looks like a spinning top. the middle of a piece of cord is then put into a notch at the top of the spindle. The ends of the cord are then wrapped around the spindle and then pulled quickly outwards causing the drill to spin. The momentum of the fly wheel causes the cord to wrap back around the spindle in the other direction. When it stops the cords are pulled outwards again and the drill spins in the other direction.
I made the first one with a stone flywheel then made fire with it in the same way I make fire with fire sticks. Then I made and fired some clay fly wheels, made another drill with one of the fly wheels and fitted a stone drill bit to the end. This one I use for drilling holes in wood. 
I used the new drill to make a hole in a piece of wood. I then put the spindle of the original cord drill through the hole in the wood, tied the ends of the cord onto the piece of wood and it became a pump drill. The cords were wrapped round the spindle as normal but now a pumping action of the wooden cross bar created the same action.
This was an interesting project. For fire making I'd stick to fire sticks because the equipment is easier to make. But for people with soft hands they could use the cord drill as it won't give them blisters. It should be added that the pump drill actually took longer than the cord drill (cord: 32 seconds, pump 1 min 30 seconds -the pump drill scene was edited down to make it watchable). The pump drill had more moving parts and was constantly having problems. As a fire making method I'd choose the cord drill over the pump drill unless all the parts were well made.

 The main purpose I'd use these tool for is drilling holes rather than fire making. It was reasonably good but the stone bits I made could be improved and their attachment to the shaft also needs some thought. If the bit loosens and gets off axis slightly the whole thing wobbles. 
These drills are impressive inventions and show potential for carpentry use later on.
